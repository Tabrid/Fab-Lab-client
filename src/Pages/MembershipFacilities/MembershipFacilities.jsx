        FabLab DIU is recognized to be one of the global matrixes for advanced
        digital fabrication laboratories, which stands with a goal for invention
        by providing access to equipment and operational, educational, technical, financial, and
        logistical assistance to aid in the creative process. From being a
        distributed research laboratory for digitizing fabrication to inventing the next generation
        of manufacturing and personal fabrication, FabLab DIU avails all the
        events needed to accomplish the goal. FabLab DIU is a small-scale work studio, open for
        all. It is an opportunity for students to join as a community to get
        encouraged to share their ideas, design, creativity and execute almost any experiment with required
        technical support.

        Joint ventures of educational institutes and industries or entrepreneurs
        can do many things to be an enhanced step for socio-economic
        developments. We, the Fab Lab DIU, provide this opportunity for both entities to collaborate.
        This partnership will consist of prototyping facilities, training, and
        workshops for both students and employees, industrial visits, developing products, troubleshooting,
        fabricating, etc. Consultancy with proper guidelines by our expert
        committees to develop products is the advantage of working together in this Lab.

        This Lab will be a university-wide facility to provide fabrication
        facilities required to manufacture and deploy potential devices/products
        that directly impact local infrastructure. The Lab aims to promote local innovations and provide
        proper fabrication facilities to meet industry standards. The Lab
        provides a proper multidisciplinary work environment where engineers and makers can
        collaborate with students and makers to make working products that local
        businesses can market. The Lab will provide necessary training to increase maker literacy
        among Lab users and outreach programs to inspire school/college students.
        Very soon this Lab will share their ideas and collaborate with approximately 1000
        Fab labs located in more than 78 countries via <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/">https://www.fablabs.io/</a>.
